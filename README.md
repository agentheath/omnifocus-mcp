> [!NOTE]
> **This is a fork** of [IllyaStarikov/omnifocus-mcp](https://github.com/IllyaStarikov/omnifocus-mcp), maintained at [agentheath/omnifocus-mcp](https://github.com/agentheath/omnifocus-mcp). It carries fixes not yet merged upstream, starting with inherited dropped state ([upstream PR #1](https://github.com/IllyaStarikov/omnifocus-mcp/pull/1)). The npm package `omnifocus-mcp-server` is the upstream release. To run this fork, build it from source (`npm install && npm run build`) and point your MCP client at `dist/index.js`.

Feature-complete [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus). Full read/write access to tasks, projects, folders, tags, and perspectives — 51 tools, 2 resources, and 3 prompts.

Uses [Omni Automation](https://omni-automation.com/) (OmniJS) under the hood, executing scripts via JXA and `osascript`. This is why macOS is required.

## Requirements

- macOS (OmniFocus is macOS-only)
- OmniFocus 4 (or OmniFocus 3 with Omni Automation support)
- Node.js >= 18
- Automation permission granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation

## Security

This server has **full read/write access** to your OmniFocus database. It can create, modify, and delete tasks, projects, folders, and tags. Only connect it to AI clients and models you trust.

No data leaves your machine — all communication happens locally via `osascript`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authorized" or no response from OmniFocus

Make sure Automation permissions are granted. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation** and ensure your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm, etc.) is allowed to control OmniFocus.

### Changes not taking effect after rebuild

If you're developing locally, multiple MCP server processes may be running (from Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.). Kill them all and restart:

```bash
pkill -f "omnifocus-mcp-server"
# or if running from source:
pkill -f "omnifocus/mcp/dist/index.js"
```

### Stale `npx` cache

If `npx` is running an old version, clear the cache:

```bash
npx clear-npx-cache
# then re-run your MCP client
```

### OmniFocus 3 compatibility

OmniFocus 3 works if Omni Automation is enabled. Go to **OmniFocus > Preferences > General** and check "Omni Automation". Some features (like certain perspective types) may behave differently.

### Tool calls are slow

Each tool call runs an `osascript` process to communicate with OmniFocus. This typically takes 200-500ms per call. Batch tools (`batch_create_tasks`, `batch_complete_tasks`, `batch_delete_tasks`) are much faster for bulk operations than calling individual tools in a loop.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev        # Run with tsx (hot reload)
npm test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode
```

### Integration Tests

Tests against a real OmniFocus instance (creates and cleans up test items):

```bash
OMNIFOCUS_LIVE=1 npm run test:integration
```

PRs welcome. Please run `npm test` before submitting and include tests for new tools.
